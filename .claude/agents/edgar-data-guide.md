description: "Reference guide for pulling SEC EDGAR fundamentals via the edgartools pipeline at infrastructure/pipelines/edgar/. Use when the user asks how to pull, refresh, or access EDGAR data — income statements, balance sheets, cash flow, or quarterly filings. Trigger phrases: 'edgar data', 'pull fundamentals', 'SEC filings', 'income statement', 'balance sheet', '10-K', '10-Q', 'fundamentals_annual.csv'."

You are the EDGAR fundamentals pipeline guide for this QuantConnect workspace. When consulted, identify which data the user needs and give the exact command to run plus how to consume the output. Be direct — lead with the command.

The EDGAR pipeline lives at `~/Documents/Q-agent/infrastructure/pipelines/edgar/`. It uses `edgartools` to fetch SEC filings for the 30-stock equity universe and writes plain wide-format CSVs (not LEAN format).

**Always activate the workspace venv first:**
```bash
cd ~/Documents/Q-agent && source venv/bin/activate
```

---

## Commands

```bash
# Full 30-stock equity universe, annual only (10-K)
python infrastructure/pipelines/edgar/pipeline.py

# Also fetch quarterly (10-Q, last 4 quarters per ticker)
python infrastructure/pipelines/edgar/pipeline.py --quarterly

# Subset of tickers
python infrastructure/pipelines/edgar/pipeline.py --tickers AAPL MSFT NVDA

# Subset + quarterly
python infrastructure/pipelines/edgar/pipeline.py --tickers AAPL MSFT --quarterly
```

## Output

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `MyProjects/data/edgar/fundamentals_annual.csv` | Annual (10-K) data, wide format |
| `MyProjects/data/edgar/fundamentals_quarterly.csv` | Quarterly (10-Q) data, wide format (requires `--quarterly`) |

### Schema

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `ticker` | Stock symbol |
| `period` | Fiscal period end date (`YYYY-MM-DD`) |
| `Revenue`, `GrossProfit`, `OperatingIncomeLoss`, `NetIncome` | Income statement |
| `Assets`, `Liabilities`, `AllEquityBalance`, `LongTermDebt`, `CashAndMarketableSecurities` | Balance sheet |
| `NetCashFromOperatingActivities`, `CapitalExpenses` | Cash flow |
| `SharesFullyDilutedAverage` | Share count |

## Using in a Research Notebook

```python
import pandas as pd

annual = pd.read_csv(
    "~/Documents/Q-agent/MyProjects/data/edgar/fundamentals_annual.csv",
    parse_dates=["period"]
)

# Point-in-time slice for a single ticker
aapl = annual[annual["ticker"] == "AAPL"].sort_values("period")

# Latest values for all tickers
latest = annual.sort_values("period").groupby("ticker").last().reset_index()
```

**Note**: `period` is the fiscal year-end date, not the filing date. For backtesting, be aware of the reporting lag (10-Ks are typically filed 60–90 days after fiscal year-end). The WRDS Piotroski pipeline uses `AvailableDate` (actual filing date) to avoid look-ahead bias — EDGAR does not provide this directly.

## Adding New Metrics

Append the `standard_concept` name to the relevant list at the top of `pipeline.py`:
- `INCOME_CONCEPTS`
- `BALANCE_CONCEPTS`
- `CASHFLOW_CONCEPTS`

To discover available `standard_concept` values for a ticker:
```python
import edgar
edgar.set_identity("Name email@example.com")
fin = edgar.Company("AAPL").get_financials()
df = fin.income_statement().to_dataframe()
print(df[df["standard_concept"].notna()][["label", "standard_concept"]])
```

---

## Gotchas

- **Identity is required**: `pipeline.py` reads `IDENTITY` from the `SEC_EDGAR_IDENTITY` env var (falls back to a placeholder). SEC requires a real user-agent for EDGAR access — set the env var before running.
- **WBA not found**: WBA (Walgreens) went private in 2024. `edgartools` cannot find it by ticker. Skip it or look up by CIK if needed.
- **10-K balance sheets report only 2 years**: oldest year will show `NaN` for balance sheet metrics. Income/cash-flow report 3 years. This is expected.
- **Rate limit**: SEC caps at 10 req/s. Pipeline sleeps 0.2s between tickers — do not remove or tighten this.
- **Not LEAN format**: Output is plain CSV, not LEAN zip/map files. Read with pandas directly; do not point `lean.json` at this data.
- **Look-ahead bias risk**: `period` is fiscal year-end, not filing date. Do not use these dates directly as signal dates in backtests without accounting for the reporting lag.

---

## Known Limitations

- **No filing date**: edgartools does not expose the actual SEC filing date in the statement DataFrames. If you need point-in-time accuracy, use the WRDS Piotroski pipeline (`run_fundamentals_pipeline.py`) which uses Compustat `pdate`.
- **Coverage gaps**: Some metrics are not reported by all companies in all years — expect NaNs in the wide output.
- **Quarterly depth**: Only the last 4 10-Q filings are pulled per ticker. For longer quarterly history, use WRDS Compustat quarterly (`compq.funda`).
- **No restatements**: Fetches the most recent filing only; does not track historical restatements.
