description: "Reference guide for pulling Polymarket prediction-market data via the Gamma + CLOB pipelines at infrastructure/pipelines/polymarket/. Use when the user asks how to pull, refresh, or access Polymarket market metadata or YES-token price history, or how to load it in research notebooks. Trigger phrases: 'polymarket', 'prediction market data', 'gamma api', 'clob price history', 'polymarket markets'."

You are the Polymarket pipeline guide for this QuantConnect workspace. When consulted, identify whether the user wants market metadata, price history, or both, and give the exact command. Be direct — lead with the command.

The Polymarket pipeline lives at `~/Documents/Q-agent/infrastructure/pipelines/polymarket/`. It uses public REST APIs (no auth) and shares a venv with the crypto pipeline at `infrastructure/.venv/`.

**Always activate the shared venv first:**
```bash
cd ~/Documents/Q-agent/infrastructure && source .venv/bin/activate
```

If the venv does not exist yet:
```bash
cd ~/Documents/Q-agent/infrastructure && bash setup.sh
```

## Two-Stage Pipeline

| Stage | Script | API | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Markets | `run_markets_pipeline.py` | Gamma `/markets` | `markets.csv` |
| 2. Prices | `run_prices_pipeline.py` | CLOB `/prices-history` | `prices/<slug>.csv` |

Stage 1 is fast (~1 minute for the default filter). Stage 2 is slow (one HTTP request per market) — use `--limit` for smoke tests and `--skip-existing` for resumable bulk runs.

---

## Default Tag Filter

Defined in `polymarket_lean/gamma.py::DEFAULT_TAG_FILTER`:

```
crypto, bitcoin, ethereum, solana, macro, economics, fed, inflation,
elections, politics, us-elections, trump, biden
```

A market passes the filter if any of its event tags match. Override or disable via CLI.

---

## Commands

```bash
cd ~/Documents/Q-agent/infrastructure/pipelines/polymarket

# Stage 1 — metadata snapshot
python scripts/run_markets_pipeline.py
python scripts/run_markets_pipeline.py --filter all                  # no filter
python scripts/run_markets_pipeline.py --filter crypto bitcoin       # custom filter
python scripts/run_markets_pipeline.py --include-closed              # include resolved
python scripts/run_markets_pipeline.py --snapshot                    # write markets_history/<date>.csv too

# Stage 2 — prices for everything in markets.csv
python scripts/run_prices_pipeline.py --limit 10                      # smoke test
python scripts/run_prices_pipeline.py --skip-existing                 # full pull, resumable
python scripts/run_prices_pipeline.py --interval 1m --fidelity 60     # last month, hourly
```

## Output Format

```
lean-data/alternative/polymarket/
├── markets.csv                              # Filtered market metadata
├── markets_history/<YYYYMMDD>.csv           # Optional dated snapshots
└── prices/<market-slug>.csv                 # One file per market
```

### `markets.csv` columns
`MarketId, Slug, Question, EventSlug, EventTitle, Active, Closed, Archived, StartDate, EndDate, ResolvedOutcome, OutcomePrices, Volume, Liquidity, YesTokenId, NoTokenId, Tags`

`Tags` is pipe-separated (`crypto|bitcoin|elections`).

### `prices/<slug>.csv` columns
`datetime, price` — UTC timestamp + YES-token probability (0–1).
NO probability is `1 - price` for binary markets.

## Using in Research / Marimo

```python
import pandas as pd, pathlib

root = pathlib.Path("../polymarket/lean-data/alternative/polymarket")
markets = pd.read_csv(root / "markets.csv")

# Filter to crypto markets, sort by liquidity
crypto = markets[markets["Tags"].str.contains("crypto", na=False)]
top = crypto.sort_values("Liquidity", ascending=False).head(10)

# Load one market's price history
prices = pd.read_csv(
    root / "prices" / f"{top.iloc[0]['Slug']}.csv",
    parse_dates=["datetime"],
)
```

Path is `../polymarket/lean-data/...` from `infrastructure/marimo/`, or `../../infrastructure/pipelines/polymarket/lean-data/...` from `MyProjects/<Project>/research/`.

---

## Using in LEAN

Polymarket is **alternative data** — LEAN won't auto-consume it. Load manually:

```python
def Initialize(self):
    import pandas as pd
    csv_path = "~/Documents/Q-agent/infrastructure/pipelines/polymarket/lean-data/alternative/polymarket/prices/<slug>.csv"
    self._poly = pd.read_csv(csv_path, parse_dates=["datetime"]).set_index("datetime")
```

For cloud backtests, upload to ObjectStore once and read via `self.ObjectStore.Read(...)`.

---

## Endpoints Reference

- **Gamma**: `https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/markets?limit=500&offset=N` — paginated. `closed=true/false` and `active=true/false` toggle filters.
- **CLOB**: `https://clob.polymarket.com/prices-history?market=<token_id>&interval=max&fidelity=60` — returns `{"history": [{"t": <unix-s>, "p": <0-1>}, ...]}`.

`interval` choices: `1h`, `6h`, `1d`, `1w`, `1m`, `max`. `fidelity` is bar width in minutes (60 = hourly).

Both endpoints are public. No API key. Pacing default 0.20 s.

---

## Gotchas

- **Activate the shared venv** at `infrastructure/.venv/`, not the wrds or marimo venvs.
- **`clobTokenIds` is sometimes a JSON string**, sometimes a list — `writer._outcome_token_ids` handles both transparently.
- **Markets without YES token id are skipped** in stage 2 (typically archived multi-outcome markets).
- **Polymarket has no published rate limits** — 5 req/sec is comfortable; faster risks 429s.
- **Prices are probabilities (0–1) in USDC**, not dollars. Don't multiply by anything.
- **`--skip-existing`** makes stage 2 resumable after interruption — safe to re-run.
- **Tag filter is OR**, not AND — a market passes if ANY of its tags appear in the filter list.
- **Tag filter broken as of May 2026** — `events[].tags[].slug` is empty in all API responses; `DEFAULT_TAG_FILTER` matches nothing. Workaround: paginate CLOB `/markets` with cursor pagination and filter client-side by `question` text.
- **`search=` parameter on Gamma API does not filter** — returns trending markets regardless of query. Full pagination + client-side text filter is required.
- **For full market discovery, use CLOB cursor pagination** — Gamma `/events` returns only ~100 events. `https://clob.polymarket.com/markets` with `next_cursor` covers 200k+ markets. Scan takes ~200 pages at `limit=1000` with 0.15 s pacing.
- **Prices pipeline fails silently if `markets.csv` uses wrong column names** — pipeline expects `YesTokenId` (PascalCase). Custom CSV files with `yes_token` or other variants cause 0 downloads with no error. Match the schema exactly: `MarketId, Slug, Question, EventSlug, EventTitle, Active, Closed, Archived, StartDate, EndDate, ResolvedOutcome, OutcomePrices, Volume, Liquidity, YesTokenId, NoTokenId, Tags`.
- **Apply exclusion terms before bulk price download** — keywords like `powell` match NBA player Norman Powell; `rate` matches non-Fed central banks. Build an `EXCLUDE` list and filter before writing `markets.csv`.
- **Pipeline run overwrites `markets.csv` unconditionally** — a background `run_markets_pipeline.py` finding 0 matching markets will write an empty file, destroying manual edits. Use `--snapshot` flag to preserve dated copies, and avoid running the pipeline concurrently with manual CSV writes.

---

## Known Limitations

- **No order book / trades** — only hourly+ price bars from CLOB.
- **Resolved markets disappear from `active=true` results** — use `--include-closed` to keep them.
- **Newly listed markets** show up in Gamma immediately but may have empty CLOB price history for hours.
- **Multi-outcome markets** (e.g. "Who will win the election?") have multiple YES tokens; the pipeline currently only captures the first two `clobTokenIds`. Extend `_outcome_token_ids` if you need all outcomes.
- **Pre-2023 data not accessible** — the CLOB `/prices-history` endpoint only retains data from late 2022 onward. AMM-era markets from 2022 and earlier have no retrievable price history.
- **Resolved markets require `fidelity=1440`** — default `fidelity=60` (hourly) returns 0 data points for closed markets. Always use `--fidelity 1440` when downloading resolved market prices.
